Data Set Description
The data contains the information about various factors which can influence salary levels such as experience, work level, job title and many more. The objective of this analysis is to obtain a better understanding of the elements that influence the salaries of data scientists and discover any regularities or tendencies within the data.
The primary objective of your work is to prepare data for further data mining and analysis.
Requirements Specifications
1.	Data Understanding
●	To understand what your data resources are and the characteristics of
those resources. Write down your findings.		

2.	Data Preparation
●	Write a python program to load data into pandas DataFrame 											
●	Write a python program to remove unnecessary columns i.e., salary and salary currency.					
●	Write a python program to remove the NaN missing values from updated dataframe. 								
●	Write a python program to check duplicates value in the dataframe. 								
●	Write a python program to see the unique values from all the columns in the dataframe.						
●	Rename the experience level columns as below.		
SE – Senior Level/Expert
MI – Medium Level/Intermediate
EN – Entry Level
EX – Executive Level								



3.	Data Analysis

●	Write a Python program to show summary statistics of sum, mean, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis of any chosen variable. 

●	Write a Python program to calculate and show correlation of all variables. 						

4.	Data Exploration

●	Write a python program to find out top 15 jobs. Make a bar graph of sales as well.         	         					               
●	Which job has the highest salaries? Illustrate with bar graph.			         							      
●	Write a python program to find out salaries based on experience level. Illustrate it through bar graph.								         						      
●	Write a Python program to show histogram and box plot of any chosen different variables. Use proper labels in the graph.				          							         

5.	Document Organization
●	Report Structure 						       


All Python programs should have screen shots of testing, results, and brief user guide in the technical report. Python codes should include adequate comments.
