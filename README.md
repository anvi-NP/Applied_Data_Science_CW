Data Set Description
The data contains the information about various factors which can influence salary levels such as experience, work level, job title and many more.<br>
The objective of this analysis is to obtain a better understanding of the elements that influence the salaries of data scientists and discover any regularities or tendencies within the data.<br>
The primary objective of your work is to prepare data for further data mining and analysis.<br>
